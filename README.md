# 🌟Full Stack Stationery Heaven Store🌟

### This project is an e-commerce application called "Stationery Heaven" that I developed to enhance my understanding of building a full-stack React and .NET app. The application allows users to browse and purchase various stationery items.

3. 🔍 Paging, Sorting, Searching, and Filtering: Implemented functionalities for smooth navigation and easy exploration of stationery items, making the user experience more efficient.
4. 🔄 Reusability with React Hook Form: Developed reusable form components using React Hook Form, improving code maintainability and efficiency.
5. 🛡️ Type Safety with TypeScript: Utilized TypeScript for type safety, ensuring robustness and reducing potential errors during development.
6. 🧙 Experience the magic of Redux Toolkit, a modern approach to managing client-side states that streamlines development and ensures smoother state management.
